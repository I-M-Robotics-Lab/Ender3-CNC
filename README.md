## Description

This is a cheap mini CNC Router that can be made from Ender-3 parts. It can complete tasks such as milling, engraving, drawing, and manufacturing PCBs. The machine is powered by Nema 17 motors, belts, and a lead screw. The electronics system of an Ender-3 with Klipper or Marlin can be directly integrated into the machine, but additional software calibration for CNC is needed.
